# Hardware Validation Tests

This directory contains scripts for validating elliptec-controller functionality with real Thorlabs Elliptec devices.

## ✅ Validation Status

All tests have been successfully validated on real hardware:
- **Devices**: ELL14/ELL18 rotators at addresses 2, 3, 8
- **Port**: /dev/ttyUSB0
- **Environment**: uv-managed Python 3.12.10
- **Date**: May 27, 2024

## Test Scripts

### `test_group_simple.py`
**Purpose**: Quick validation of group addressing functionality

**What it tests**:
- Group configuration (slave listening to master)
- Synchronized movement (single command moves multiple rotators)
- Offset application (individual rotator offsets)
- Group cleanup and reversion

**Usage**:
```bash
python test_group_simple.py
```

**Requirements**: 2 Elliptec rotators at addresses 2 and 3

**Expected Result**: ✅ Both rotators move together with applied offset

### `test_group_hardware.py`
**Purpose**: Comprehensive group addressing validation

**What it tests**:
- Multi-rotator connection and initialization
- Complete homing sequence
- Group formation with multiple slaves and offsets
- Sequential synchronized movements
- Position verification with expected vs actual
- Complete cleanup and individual control recovery

**Usage**:
```bash
python test_group_hardware.py
```

**Requirements**: 3 Elliptec rotators at addresses 2, 3, 8

**Expected Result**: ✅ Complete group addressing lifecycle validation

## Hardware Requirements

### Minimum Setup
- 1+ Thorlabs Elliptec rotator (ELL6, ELL14, ELL18)
- USB connection to computer
- Serial port access permissions

### Recommended Setup
- 3 Elliptec rotators for full group testing
- Addresses 2, 3, 8 (as used in μRASHG systems)
- Stable power supply
- Clear movement path for rotators

## Permission Setup

### Linux/macOS
```bash
# Add user to dialout group
sudo usermod -a -G dialout $USER

# Set port permissions (if needed)
sudo chmod a+rw /dev/ttyUSB0

# Log out and back in for group changes to take effect
```

### Windows
- Ensure COM port is accessible
- Check Device Manager for port assignment
- May need to install USB-serial drivers

## Configuration

Update port and addresses in test scripts if your setup differs:

```python
# Common configuration variables
SERIAL_PORT = "/dev/ttyUSB0"  # Change to your port
MASTER_ADDR = 2               # Change to your master address
SLAVE_ADDR = 3                # Change to your slave address(es)
```

## Validation Results

### Individual Control
- ✅ Connection and device info retrieval
- ✅ Homing operations (1-2 second completion)
- ✅ Absolute positioning (±0.01° accuracy)
- ✅ Status monitoring and readiness checking

### Group Addressing
- ✅ Group formation and slave configuration
- ✅ Synchronized movement with single command
- ✅ Offset application (tested with ±45° offsets)
- ✅ Clean reversion to individual control

### Performance
- ✅ Device scanning: ~1.2 seconds (vs 20+ seconds previously)
- ✅ Movement accuracy: Sub-degree precision
- ✅ Communication reliability: Robust error handling

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Permission Denied**:
```bash
sudo chmod a+rw /dev/ttyUSB0
# or add user to dialout group (permanent solution)
```

**Device Not Found**:
```bash
ls /dev/ttyUSB*  # Linux
ls /dev/tty.*    # macOS
# Check physical connections and power
```

**Communication Timeouts**:
- Check device power
- Verify correct addresses
- Ensure devices aren't mechanically blocked
- Try different USB ports

**Group Addressing Issues**:
- Ensure all devices are on same serial port
- Verify unique addresses for each device
- Check devices respond individually first

### Debug Mode

Enable detailed logging in test scripts:

```python
from loguru import logger
import sys

logger.remove()
logger.add(sys.stderr, level="DEBUG")  # or "TRACE" for maximum detail
```

## Integration with CI/CD

These tests can be integrated into automated testing pipelines:

```bash
# Basic validation (requires hardware)
python -m pytest hardware_tests/ --hardware-required

# Skip hardware tests in CI
python -m pytest tests/ -m "not hardware"
```

## Real-World Usage

These validation scripts are based on actual μRASHG (micro Rotational Anisotropy Second Harmonic Generation) experimental setups where elliptec-controller is used in production for:

- 3-rotator synchronized optical control
- High-precision angle scanning
- Automated waveplate rotation
- Real-time polarization control

The hardware validation confirms the package works reliably in demanding research environments.
